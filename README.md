# PV080 Information Security and Cryptography Project

This repository is part of the course PV080 Information Security and Cryptography at Masaryk University. The project aims to explore and address security vulnerabilities in Python code, utilizing Dependabot for dependency management.

## Overview

- Course: PV080 Information Security and Cryptography
- University: Masaryk University
- Semester: Spring 2022

## Project Description

The project focuses on identifying and fixing security vulnerabilities within a Python codebase. Security issues related to dependencies are especially targeted. The use of Dependabot is emphasized to automate the process of keeping dependencies up-to-date.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the Repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/pv080-security-project.git
cd pv080-security-project
```

2. Install Dependencies:
Ensure that Python is installed on your machine. Use a virtual environment for dependency management.
```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use "venv\Scripts\activate"
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Explore the Codebase:
Familiarize yourself with the Python code in the repository. Identify areas that may contain security vulnerabilities.

4. Use Dependabot:
Dependabot is configured to monitor and update dependencies automatically. Review Dependabot alerts and merge updates to address vulnerabilities.
